# LunchTime
## Why this App?

**Are you hungry and it is time to propose a Lunch Time?**
Than this App will help (in case you are a memember from the Hasenauer Lab!)

OR

**You want to get close to members of the Hasenauer group? To watch them eat ?**
Than this App is for you! Come close! We have slow eaters at the group which are most likely still at Mensa...

OR

**You want to check in a really inconvenient way if R's `sample` actually does uniform sample?**
Than get your hands on the data generated here!

## Feature Overview
- Gives everyday a Lunch time between 11:30 and 12:00 (expect on weekends and every second Tuesdays (not too sure if that actually works))
- displays the current time (currently you have to think of plus one hour, as the server on which the app is hosted apparently is not in our timezone - did not bother to fix as I hope we can argue to get it on our intern Shiny Server)
- Button which can be only clicked once per day, to capture the actual time we leave for lunch (DO NOT MISUSE!)
- Button to download the Lunch Time stats incl. Date, Weekday, proposed lunchtime and actual lunch time (in convenient csv format)

## Contribution
Ask to be a collab and then you can play along.
